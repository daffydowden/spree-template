Use this set of templates to style your spree e-commerce site. The html templates are the exact spree sources, so all layouts and selectors match. This should make it easier for designers to modify the spree look and easier for developers to skin their sites.

Page templates include both the spree default stylesheet screen.css and site.css, a stylesheet you can use to override the default.
Feel free to remove screen.css and create your own from scratch.
